## Setup dev environment

1. Check that you have Python 3.8 or newer installed
2. Clone the repo from git
3. Make python virtual env with ```python3 -m venv theBrowser``` and activate it ```source theBrowser/bin/activate```
4. Install dependencies by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
5. Happy hacking! :)
